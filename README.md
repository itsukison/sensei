## File Structure

```
â”œâ”€â”€ manifest.json       # Extension manifest (V3)
â”œâ”€â”€ background.js       # Service worker for API calls
â”œâ”€â”€ content.js         # Content script for text detection
â”œâ”€â”€ styles.css         # UI styling
â”œâ”€â”€ popup.html         # Settings popup HTML
â”œâ”€â”€ popup.js          # Settings popup JavaScript
â””â”€â”€ README.md         # This file
```

## Development

The extension starts in **development mode** with mock API responses. This allows you to test the UI and functionality without API costs.

### Mock Responses

The extension includes pre-configured responses for:

- "I need this done immediately!" â†’ Professional alternative
- "You're wrong about this." â†’ Collaborative alternative
- Generic text â†’ "Already professional" response

### Testing

1. Open any website with text input
2. Type one of the test phrases above
3. Observe the suggestion popup
4. Test the "Accept" and "Dismiss" buttons

## Browser Compatibility

- **Chrome**: Fully supported (Manifest V3)
- **Edge**: Compatible (Chromium-based)
- **Firefox**: Not supported (uses different extension API)

## Privacy & Security

- **No Data Storage**: Text is only sent to chosen AI provider
- **Local Processing**: All UI logic runs locally
- **Secure API Calls**: API keys stored locally in Chrome storage
- **No Tracking**: Extension doesn't collect usage data

## Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Working

1. Check if developer mode is enabled
2. Reload the extension in `chrome://extensions/`
3. Check browser console for errors

### API Errors

1. Verify your API key is correct
2. Check your API provider account has credits
3. Test API connection using the "Test API" button

### Suggestions Not Appearing

1. Ensure auto-check is enabled in settings
2. Check minimum word count setting
3. Try manual check with Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+T

## Known Limitations

- Some websites with complex text editors may not be fully supported
- API rate limits apply based on your provider plan
- Extension requires internet connection for real API calls

## Contributing

This is a prototype. To enhance:

1. Add support for more text editor types
2. Improve tone analysis prompts
3. Add more sophisticated UI animations
4. Implement offline mode with local models
